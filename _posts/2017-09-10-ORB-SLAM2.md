    In a previous issue we have identified possible algorithms we can use to implement our goal: generating a semantic map for our autonomous vehicles that will be driving in Delft. <br /><br />
    One of them is <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/tum-vision/lsd_slam">LSD SLAM</a>. In order to get a rough outline of how a SLAM algorithm operates we want to install and run the algorithm so we can examine the output it gives. By examining the setup and output of LSD SLAM we have come to the conclusion that it is not suitable for our applications.

    Two of the more prominent algorithms are identified by the arrow in front of the name. Henceforth we will be working and examining the inner workings of SVO (the monocular version, because it is opensource) and ORB_SLAM2 (the improved ORB_SLAM algorithm that now supports stereo input).
