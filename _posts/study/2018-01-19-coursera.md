In order to get an understanding for Machine Learning and it's applications we have been assigned lectures and assignments from Coursera, namely the course from Stanford University about Machine Learning. This has been an excellent resource for information and knowledge and a great help by understanding the various concepts introduced to us during our 20 week period.
