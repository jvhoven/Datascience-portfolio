In order to work on the project some knowledge about Python is required. Therefore we were given assignments and study material through Datacamp. DataCamp is a time flexible, online data science learning platform offering tutorials and courses in data science. Students can master data analysis from the comfort of their browser, at their own pace, and tailored to their needs and expertise.
