    In a previous issue we have identified possible algorithms we can use to implement our goal: generating a semantic map for our autonomous vehicles that will be driving in Delft. <br /><br />
    One of them is <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/tum-vision/lsd_slam">LSD SLAM</a>. In order to get a rough outline of how a SLAM algorithm operates we installed and ran the algorithm so we could examine the output it gives. By examining the setup and output of LSD SLAM we came to the conclusion that it is not suitable for our application. One of the biggest factors why we would not be going forward with LSD SLAM was because the input images had to be of factor 16, which is a big limitation for real-time usage.

    Two of the more prominent algorithms are identified by the arrow in front of the name. Henceforth we will be working and examining the inner workings of SVO (the monocular version, because it is open-source) and ORB_SLAM2 (the improved ORB_SLAM algorithm that now supports stereo input).
