    In a previous issue we have identified possible algorithms we can use to implement our goal: generating a semantic map for our autonomous vehicles that will be driving in Delft. <br /><br />
    One of them is <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2">ORB_SLAM2</a>. This algorithm is the next on the list of to research SLAM implementations. The goal of this issue was setting up, testing and examining the output of ORB_SLAM2. ORB_SLAM2 showed promising results because of its available documentation and opensource implementation. The outcome of this experiment was rather promising, therefore we have decided to continue investigating ORB_SLAM2 and it's inner workings.

    Two of the more prominent algorithms are identified by the arrow in front of the name. Henceforth we will be working and examining the inner workings of SVO (the monocular version, because it is opensource).
